// Week 2 - Loops

// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers) between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
let i =1;
while(i<=5){
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers) between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
let i = 1;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
while (i <= 5);

// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers) between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
for(let i =1; i <=5; i++){
  console.log(i);
};
// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

console.log(`WHILE`);
let i = 10;
while (i > 0) {
  console.log(i);
  i--;
}

console.log(`
DO WHILE`);
let x = 10;
do {

  console.log(x);
  x--;

}
while (x > 0);

console.log(`
FOR`);
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
  console.log(i)
}
// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

console.log(`WHILE`);
let i = 7;
while (i <=27) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
};

console.log(`
DO WHILE`);
let x = 7;
do {
  console.log(x);
  x++;

}
while (x <=27);

console.log(`
FOR`);
for (let i = 7; i <=27 ; i++) {
  console.log(i)
};
// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc.
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

console.log(`WHILE`);
let i =0;
while (i <=100) {
  console.log(i);
  i = i +10;
}

console.log(`
DO WHILE`);
let x = 0;
do {
  console.log(x);
  x = x +10;

}
while (x <=100);

console.log(`
FOR`);
for (let i = 0; i <=100 ; i = i +10) {
  console.log(i)
}
// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will run without ever stopping). 
//Then fix the loop so that it stops when counterFour is equal to -100.

let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour < 2) {
  console.log("HELP ME!");
  counterFour--;
  if(counterFour == -100){
    break;
  }
}
//This is an infinite loop because counterFour will never be greater than 2, counterFour keeps lowering in quantity and there is no break in the loop.

// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.
for(let i =0; i <=120; i++){
  console.log(i);
}
// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)
for(let i =0; i <=12; i++){
    if(i == 12){
    i += " my favorite number!"
  }
  console.log(i + " not my favorite number");

}
// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:
//A FOR loop should be used when you need it to run a number of times. 
//A WHILE loop should be used when you want to break at some point. 
//A WHILE Loop when you want to run the code at least once. 

// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
*********************************** 
counting down from 1
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
*/

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter++) {
  console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
  for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter <= 3; insideCounter--) {
    if (insideCounter == 0) {
      break;
    }
    console.log("inside " + insideCounter);
  }
  console.log("***********************************");
}


// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
//I found exercise 11 a bit difficult, mostly because of the code suggestions. I assume it is imperative to include the code suggestions in the same spot
//or that they cannot be moved. Asides from that the problem were relatively simple, I just need to learn to know when to use the while, do while, and for loops.
